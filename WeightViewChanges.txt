Within the weights view:
	When first opening the page, the triangle animates in both X and Y
	Weight sliders Call, Text and Facetime can be adjusted
	When a slider is released a smaller animation is made
	The whole graph can be rotated/spun

Etiher animation time, direction and trigger can be changed. (Or fully removed)
Colors for the inner lines, outer lines and the triangle and fill can be changed.
The graph can be locked in place to avoid spinning.
Fonts, font sizes and their colors can also be adjusted.

Currently, the values when loading the view are preset but it is defined within an instance of a Struct named Weights that can be changed.
Possibly latter it can be made to be given values through a function outside of the view.
