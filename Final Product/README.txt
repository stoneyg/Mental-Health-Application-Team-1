Helping Hand Application Instructions

NOTE: Xcode is required to run the application simulation.

Everything needed to run Helping Hand is contained within the folder titled "Mental Health App Final Demo".  Download the entire file, as all of it's contents are needed to run the application.  Once it has been downloaded, run the "Mental Health Application.xcodeproj" file, which will open the project in Xcode.  Before the simulation can be run, make sure to click on the orange tool (hammer) button in the top bar of Xcode and change the Build System to "Legacy Build System."  For reference, a screenshot called "EnableLegacyBuild.png" has been included in teh Final Product folder.

If it is not already, it is advised to switch the simulator to iPhone 11, then click the play button.  This will launch the iPhone 11 simulator, which in turn automatically runs the Helping Hand application.  A rundown of the application functionality can be viewed in the Youtube video on the second slide of the "Final Demo.pptx" in the Final Product folder.

For reference here, clicking See Circle will display the csv files included in the files that were downloaded, upon which you select the file named "TrustCalculation."  Clicking the button "Order Contacts" will now display in the Xcode console the top three contacts from the csv as calculated by the trust algorithm.

The Weights button can also be used to adjust how the trust algorithm weighs different froms of communication.  Repeat the steps above and you will see in console that the values have changed.

For further documentation on more in-depth functionality of how the application works, please see the files ending in "Final" that are included in the Deliverables folder, off the main master branch in this GitHub repository.
